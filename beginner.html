       <center><h2>Basics of Dungeons and Dragons</h2></center>
        <center>This area will help those who may not have the greatest grasp of the basic mechanics of the game itself.
            In this area we will be touching down on the different skills used in Dungeons and Dragons. Below are some
            basic pieces to help beginners with some things about Dungeons and Dragons.

<em><h3>Stats broken down:</h3></em>
        <p>In this game we have six stats: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each
            one is going to play an important role in the game as such: Say we have a hero by the name of <strong>Erick</strong>, He is
            a well rounded hero who will be taking us through the paces of just what each stat means.</center>
    <hr size="2">
            <ul>
        <li><strong>Strength:</strong> <em> Strength, governs just how strong Erick's grip is to crush a fresh tomato.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Dexterity:</strong><em> Erick spots a vagabond throwing a tomato at him, <strong>Dexterity</strong> would 
        dictate how well Erick can get out of the way of the thrown tomato.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Constitution:</strong> <em> is just how healthy Erick is, after eating a rotten tomato. 
            If Erick has a weak Constitution. Erick would get sick from eating a rotten tomato.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Intelligence:</strong><em>Intelligence tells our hero Erick that a tomato is indeed a fruit. Not a vegetable.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Wisdom:</strong> <em>While Intelligence tells our hero Erick that a tomato is a fruit. <strong>Wisdom</strong>
        dictates that putting tomatoes in a fruit salad would be silly.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Charisma:</strong><em> last but certainly not least is the Charisma stat. Which is how well our hero Erick
        can sell a basket of tomatoes, will he get a good price?</em></li>
    </ul>

<p>One of the most confusing things for myself as a Dungeons and Dragons player when I first started out was the dice rolls. There are so
    many different dice and so many things to roll for: skills, attacks,reflexes, talking sometimes even! Two things that really needed to 
    be discussed that I think a lot of new players get skimmed over would be <strong>Taking a 10, and taking a 20.</strong> When one 'takes a 20'
    they are taking an action that isn't under duress, there isn't combat going on or anything that could cause them to be under a circumstance 
    that would cause panic or any kind of anxiety of the like. In some cases (much like when I DM) it can take an upwards of an hour to perform the
    task. Depending on what it is. For instance.</p>
<p>
    <em>Mordecai wants to break into a locked room, they know the door is boobytrapped. Mordecai can take a <strong>  20</strong> if they aren't under duress, to take
        their time, disarming the trap and to pick the lock. A <strong>20</strong> is an automatic success in most cases (Natural being the most obvious case.)
