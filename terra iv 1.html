  <p>This is the world of Terra IV as it's stood for over 300 years. Once upon a
    time ago the world was once a world pangea known as Clagis. In this world all
    world's tribes and cities were fare more tense with each other. However...
    when the awakening of the hero-gods had been awakened, a grand change to the
    world had taken place. Splitting the world into not just two, but <strong>four
    continents.</strong>The creation of the <strong><em>"Triad":</em></strong> <a href="Asora.html">Asora</a>,
    <a href="Xarus.html">Xarus</a> and of course <a href="Cusbris.html">Cusbris</a>.
    When the triad was born from the selfless acts of <a href="Padrig.html">Padrig</a>.
  He shed his mortal coil to create the three aspects of the soul. And when they
were born they had used their power to break apart the pangea of Clagis to reshape the world.
Partly creating the rift between the greater gods and the hero-gods.</p>
